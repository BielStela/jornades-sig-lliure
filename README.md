# Python as GIS workshop
To run the notebook we will need two environments. Almost everything can be ran with `environment11.yml`
 easily with if docker is your friend.
```
docker compose up py11
```

The notebook `cogs.ipynb` needs a special environment because of a recent dependenci update wreckage :(


```
docker compose up py9
```
